# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Dr. Priya Sharma (MD pending - hasn't completed residency)

**Occupation:** Medical Resident (on leave) / Pre-residency Gap Year Traveler

## Archetype
**Primary:** Know-It-All Expert

**Secondary traits:** Overachiever, burnout case, parents' expectations embodied

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Arrogance

**How it manifests:**
- Dismisses her symptoms using medical knowledge to rationalize
- Refuses to seek local medical help because she "knows better"
- Continues socializing while symptomatic because she's "pretty sure it's not contagious"

**How it kills them:**
Her medical training makes her overconfident in self-diagnosis. By the time she admits she's seriously ill, it's too late - and she's infected the entire hostel.

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Intelligent - becomes intellectual arrogance that dismisses others' input
2. Self-reliant - becomes refusal to accept help until too late

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Cannot admit she might be wrong - won't accept she's sick
2. Condescending about medical matters - dismisses local doctors

### Pet Peeves
- Medical misinformation (ironic: becomes a vector of disease herself)
- People who don't wash their hands

### Fears
- Surface fear: Failing her medical boards
- Deeper fear: That she pursued medicine for her parents, not herself

## Background

### Origin Story
First-generation American, daughter of immigrant doctors who sacrificed everything for her education. Top of her class through sheer pressure. Medical school was assumed, not chosen. Burned out during third year, took "medical leave" that's really a desperate escape from expectations.

### Why They Travel
Officially: "gaining global health perspective." Really: delaying the return to a career she's not sure she wants. Proving she can be "normal" and carefree despite her achievement-obsessed upbringing.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
It was the cheapest option in a remote but beautiful location. She justified it as "exposure to different health conditions." Arrived already run down from months of non-stop travel.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "statistically," "symptomatically," "differential diagnosis," "probably just"
- Avoids words like: "I don't know," "help," "I'm scared"
- Catchphrases: "Trust me, I'm almost a doctor" / "I've seen this a hundred times"

### Speech Pattern
- Clinical and precise when discussing health
- Reverts to casual speech when trying to seem "normal"
- Becomes impatient when people don't understand medical concepts

### Internal Monologue Style
Constant medical self-assessment. Running differential diagnoses on herself. Bargaining with symptoms to not be serious.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** LinkedIn (professional), Instagram (travel)
- **Follower count:** 3,200
- **Posting style:** Mix of travel photos and humble-brags about medical achievements
- **Last post before death:** Photo of hostel breakfast with caption "Fuel for another adventure day! (Yes Mom, I'm eating vegetables)"

### Online vs Reality
Projects confident world-traveler who has life figured out. Reality: terrified she's wasted her youth and doesn't know who she is without achievement.

## Relationships

### Family
- Parents text daily with medical advice and residency application reminders
- Younger brother is the "disappointment" who's actually happier

### Friends
- Med school cohort she's drifted from
- A few hostel friends who think she's cool

### Romantic
- Single; med school left no time for relationships; secretly lonely

### At the Hostel
- Becomes informal "hostel doctor" - giving medical advice to guests
- Bonds with other long-term travelers over burnout stories
- Has started something with a charming British backpacker (who she infects)

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes up struggling to breathe. Finally admits this isn't just fatigue. Tries to reach the door. Can't.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Three days earlier: laughing at dinner, telling herself the cough is just dust from the trek.

### Final Thoughts
"I should have said something. I should have stayed home. I'm so sorry."

### Last Words
"Tell my parents... I tried..." (whispered to nurse through hazmat suit)
