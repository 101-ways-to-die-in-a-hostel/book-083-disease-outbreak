## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Sokha Meas
**Description:** 35-year-old mother of three, manages the hostel for her family. Limited English but warm personality. Has seen travelers get sick before but never like this.
**Role in death:** First to notice Priya was seriously ill; called for help; later infected, survives

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Rosa | Older woman, speaks no English; dies from infection |
| Cook | Dara | Sokha's husband; handles food with bare hands |
| Guide | Vannak | Led the bat cave trek; unknowingly brought group to virus source |
| Manager/Owner | The Meas Family | Three generations on-site |

### Staff Knowledge
They know the hostel cuts corners but believe it's "good enough." They've never dealt with anything like this. Vannak knows the bat cave legend but not the scientific risk.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Lazy hammock culture. Guests nursing hangovers or preparing for treks. Sound of someone practicing guitar badly. Card games on common platform.

### Night Vibe
Fire pit gatherings. Beer. Sharing travel stories. Occasional local karaoke drifts from town. Mosquito coils burning.

### Guest Demographics
Younger budget travelers (18-30), adventure seekers, a few older digital nomads, couples on "rough it" honeymoons.

### Reputation
TripAdvisor: 4.0 stars - "Amazing location, basic but charming, bring bug spray, not for germaphobes"
Lonely Planet: "An authentic Cambodian experience away from the tourist hordes"

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Cambodia's rural tourist areas have limited healthcare. Nipah-like viruses have emerged from bat caves in Southeast Asia. Bamboo hostels with shared facilities are common. Outbreak response infrastructure is limited.

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Show Cambodians as capable people in difficult circumstances
- Avoid "dirty foreign country" tropes - focus on infrastructure gaps
- Note that similar outbreaks happen in Western settings too
- Respect the complexity of developing-world healthcare

### Sources
- WHO outbreak reports from Southeast Asia
- Travel health advisories for Cambodia
- Nipah virus research papers
